# SlideHop
 Sega Saturn Homebrew

This is the source code frozen for the release build of Slide Hop, a Sega Saturn homebrew project.
It also includes the assets (some stolen) needed to build the game, alongside the tools.
I, the developer (Ponut64), will be moving on to other projects in my other repositories.
As such, as of January 1st 2024, this will look similar to other repos I have posted...
but this one shouldn't change any further.
